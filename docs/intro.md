# Introduction

## Overview
A lightweight spatial library for Roblox that replaces expensive physics queries with fast, math-based entity tracking at scale.

QuickZone makes it possible to track thousands of entities across hundreds of zones with very little impact on your frame rate. It bypasses Roblox's physics engine in favor of geometric math while providing a predictable, budgeted, and flexible solution for zone detection.

:::info Point-Based Detection
QuickZone uses point-based detection. It checks if a specific point (e.g., the center of a Part, the position of an Attachment, or the Pivot of a Model) is inside a zone's boundary.

Because it calculates if it is inside or not using geometric math instead of physics-based volume intersections, it is significantly faster than other zone detection libraries.

## Core Features

- **Fast Spatial Queries**: Process thousands of spatial queries per second with negligible FPS impact.

- **Track Anything**: Track BaseParts, Models, Attachments, Bones, Cameras, or even pure Lua tables. If it has a position, QuickZone can track it.

- **Shape Support**: Supports mathematical containment for Blocks, Balls, Cylinders, and Wedges without relying on physics collision meshes.

- **Decoupled Architecture**: Separate game logic from spatial instances. Bind behaviors to categories of entities (Players, NPCs, Projectiles) for a clean, scalable architecture.

- **Budgeted Scheduler**: Remove lag spikes by setting a hard frame budget (e.g., 1ms). Workload is smeared across frames to maintain a flat and predictable performance profile.

- **Zero-Allocation Runtime**: By using contiguous arrays and object pooling, QuickZone reduces GC pressure, avoiding memory-related stutters.

## Installation

### Wally
The package name + version is

```
ldgerrits/quickzone@^0.2.2
```

### Manual
Download the latest .rbxm model file from the [Releases](https://github.com/LDGerrits/QuickZone/releases) tab and drag it into ReplicatedStorage.

## Quick Start
The following example demonstrates a 'Water Zone' system. It uses an Observer to apply swimming logic to the LocalPlayerGroup only when they are inside a specific area.
```lua
local Players = game:GetService('Players')
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage')
local QuickZone = require(ReplicatedStorage.QuickZone)

-- Create a LocalPlayerGroup that automatically tracks the client's character (including respawns)
local myPlayer = QuickZone.LocalPlayerGroup()

-- Create an observer with a priority of 42. If zones overlap, higher priority observers resolve first.
local swimObserver = QuickZone.Observer(42)
swimObserver:subscribe(myPlayer)

-- Define behavior
swimObserver:onLocalPlayerEntered(function(zone)
    local char = Players.LocalPlayer.Character
    if char then
        char.Humanoid:SetStateEnabled(Enum.HumanoidStateType.Swimming, true)
        char.Humanoid:ChangeState(Enum.HumanoidStateType.Swimming)
    end
end)

swimObserver:onLocalPlayerExited(function(zone)
    local char = Players.LocalPlayer.Character
    if char then
        char.Humanoid:ChangeState(Enum.HumanoidStateType.GettingUp)
    end
end)

-- Create zones and attach them to the observer to let the observer 'see'
local poolZone = QuickZone.ZoneFromPart(workspace.PoolWater)
poolZone:attach(swimObserver)
```
